# Hi!👋

I’m Albert, a first-year at the University of Virginia’s School of Engineering and Applied Science intending to major in Computer Science with a prospective minor in Systems Engineering.

I’m interested about software development, data science, system design, and how to utilize these fields to create solutions that create a better world.

In my freetime I love weightlifting, listening to Daniel Caesar, sipping on coffee or tea, and spending time with my community! 😁
